Minibuffer Console Cheatsheet
=============================

This is a curated list of Minibuffer key bindings and commands that represent
the least commands one ought to have on hand to make the most out of Minibuffer,
making it both usable and discoverable.

Minimal Usable
--------------

key              | command                  | description
---              | -------                  | -----------
alt-x or :       | execute-extended-command | Reads a command and its arguments then executes it
alt-X            | execute-user-command     | Executes a command; does not show system commands
escape or ctrl-g | keyboard-quit            | Quit the current operation; two quits will hide minibuffer
~                | toggle-visibility        | Toggle minibuffer visibility
.                | repeat-last-command      | Repeat the last command
ctrl-u           | universal-argument       | Pass a numerical or boolean argument to the next command
ctrl-x v         | edit-variable            | Edit a variable
tab              | minibuffer-complete      | Tab complete or show available completions

Minimal Discoverable
--------------------

key              | command                  | description
---              | -------                  | -----------
ctrl-h B         | describe-user-bindings   | Show key bindings
ctrl-h b         | describe-bindings        | Show key bindings
ctrl-h c         | describe-command         | Show method, class, and keybindings for command
ctrl-h k         | describe-key             | Reports what command is run for a key sequence
ctrl-h v         | describe-variable        | Show type, class, and description for a variable
ctrl-h h         | help-for-help            | Show the master help page

Since Minibuffer allows for key sequences, sometimes you'll wonder what else is
bound to `ctrl-c`? In that case, type `ctrl-c ctrl-h` and it'll show you all the
key bindings that start with `ctrl-c`.
